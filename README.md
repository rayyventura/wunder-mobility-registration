# Wunder Mobility test

Possible Optimizations:
* Integrate with a zip-code API to bring the address data from it authomatically, improving the user experience.

Things that can be improved:
* As it was my first time working with SCSS, I wasn't pretty used to it, since I normally use styled-components. It wasn't difficult to implement, even though I believe I have made it more complex than it should be. So, having more experience with this css framework and refactoring my stylesheet is definitely something I have to work on.

The api that I've buit to persist the data is:
