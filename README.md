# Wunder Mobility test

Possible Optimizations:
* Integrate with a zip-code API to bring the address data from it. authomatically, improving the user experience 
* Integrate with the Endpoint so the Payment data can be stored and recieve the proper paymentd for the success page. 
* Refactor the logic to be DRY and mantainable

Think that could be improved:
* As it was my first time working with SCSS, I wasn't pretty used to it, since I normally use styled-components. It wasn't difficult to implement, even though I believe I have made it more complex than it should be. So, having more experience with this css framework and refactoring my stylesheet is definitely something I have to work on. 
* Other than that, I wasn't able to access the Enpoint proposed due to credential restrtrictions. So this is also an aspect to improve. 
Here is also the link for an API that I've built to persist the user-data:
