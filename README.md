# Wunder Mobility test

Possible Optimizations:
* Integrate with a zip-code API to bring the address data from it. authomatically, improving the user experience 
* Integrate with the Endpoint so the Payment data can be stored and recieve the proper paymentd for the success page. 
* Refactor the logic to be DRY and mantainable

Think that could be improved:
* As it was my first time working with SCSS, I wasn't pretty used to it, since I normally use styled-components. It wasn't difficult to implement, even though I believe I have made it more complex than it should be. So, having more experience with this css framework and refactoring my stylesheet is definitely something I have to work on. 
* Other than that, I wasn't able to access the endpoint proposed in the front-end due to credential restrtrictions (CORS). So I've developed an endpoint in the back-end to do so.

The api that I've buit to persist the data is:
